Wordpress WooThemes' Canvas Mobile Menu Addition. Hides sub-menus in mobile mode and shows them only when clicked.

== Description ==

Wordpress WooThemes' Canvas Mobile Menu Addition. Hides sub-menus in mobile mode and shows them only when clicked.

This will add the display:none property to all sub-menus so that only the top-level menus are shown in mobile mode.

When the top-level menu is clicked it will show the sub-menus below it. If you click on the top-level menu a 2nd time it will route to the top-level menu URL destination.

This plugin works recursively, so this will allow sub-menus which have sub-menus within them to behave the same way.

**There is also sometimes a CSS glitch if you leave the menu open in mobile mode and then resize the window to a another mode, this plugin fixes that issue by closing the menu whenever the width is resized.

== Installation ==

Install the .zip file using Wordpress

-or-

1. Unzip and upload the `canvas-nav` directory into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin hide my submenus? =

Yes, but only when the window size is less than 767 pixels, which is what Canvas uses to trigger it's mobile responsive mode.

= What about my target link? =

When the parent menu is clicked a 2nd time in a row it will redirect the user to the link. It's very intuitive.
